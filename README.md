# Ash Documentation
The documentation for the [Ash programming language](https://github.com/ash-lang/ash).

Ash is an imperative and object-oriented programming language that sits on top of the Java platform. Some of its aims are:

* To modernise the syntax and semantics of Java
* To compile down to Java bytecode
* To be totally inter-operable with Java with no extra work

It is currently under heavy development, so many features that are planned are not implemented yet (see the issues section of the main repo for the to-do list). In addition, this set of documentation may not be up to date as language features may be changed at any time.

Suggestions and help are welcomed, see the issues section of you'd like to propose an idea or let us know about a bug.
