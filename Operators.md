# Operators
The operators that are defined by the compiler or standard libarary are as follows:

| >>>      | logical_right_shift | Binary | Integers                                     | The same as the right shift but performs an arithmetic shift instead              |
| ===      | value_equality      | Binary | Either optional or non-optional Objects      | Returns operand1.equals(operand2). It handles null cases too.                     |
| ??       | not_null            | Binary | An optional object and a non-optional object | Returns the first operand if it is not null, else it returns the second operand   |

## Operator types
An operator can either be binary, postfix or prefix. Binary operators appear in between two expressions. Prefix operators appear on the left of a single expression, and postfix operators appear on the right.

## Operator bytecode names
The operator bytecode name is the name that an operator's overloads take in the generated bytecode. The operators themselves (such as `+`) are not accepted as valid names by the JVM.

## Operator definitions
You can create your own operators and overload them. An operator definition is denoted by the `operator` keyword, the operator itself (e.g. `++`), an equals sign, a type and then the bytecode name. Binary operators must then also provide an associativity and then a precedence.

```
operator ! = type: prefix, name: bool_not
```

The above example is the deifnition of the boolean NOT operator in the standard library.

```
operator ** = type: binary, name: pow, assoc: none, prec: 120
```

The above example is the deifnition of the "pow" operator in the standard library.

Operator definitions can only be present in [definition files](Definition_files.md)

Custom operators are overloaded in the same way as normal operator overloads.
